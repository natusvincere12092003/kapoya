Object: One player thinks of a word and
the other tries to guess it by guessing
letters. Each incorrect guess brings you
closer to being "hanged." This game
helps to sharpen childrenâ€™s spelling and
word-decoding skills.
<br>
<br>
Directions: Decide who is going first. Start the game by having this person choose a word
or phrase in their mind. (Choose a word from the book just read, and for quick reference to
the word, use a bookmark to keep track of the page it is located on.)
<br>
Place one dash on the bottom of the game board for each letter of the word or words
chosen. Leave a space between words.
<br>
<br>
If the word is dog, draw three spaces, like this: __ __ __.
Have the other player guess one letter at a time - or he or she can use a turn to guess the
entire word or words.
<br>
Fill in the letter everywhere it appears on the appropriate dash (or dashes) each time the
person guesses correctly. Circle the letter on the alphabet if is guessed correctly. Add one
body part to the drawing each time the letter chosen is not in the word. Begin by drawing a
head attached to the short vertical line (the "noose"). 
<br>
Add eyes, ears, nose, hair, body, legs,
and arms. Put an X through the letter that was guessed and not correct. You may also wish
to make your drawings very elaborate - one ear at a time, a neck, and a belly button - so that
children will have a lot of guesses before losing.
<br>
If the drawing of the person is completed before the word or words are guessed, the
guessing player loses. If the player figures out the word or words first, he or she wins
